Analyze this image for anomalies in a block sorting task. Look for blocks that are placed incorrectly or in the wrong location.

IMPORTANT: Respond ONLY with valid JSON in the following exact format:

{
  "anomaly": "normal|pose_error|missing_block|extra_block|color_mismatch",
  "action": "action_name_from_list",
  "target_id": "target_id_from_list", 
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of what you detected"
}

Rules:
- If no anomalies detected, set "anomaly": "normal", "action": "", "target_id": ""
- If anomaly detected, pick the most appropriate action from the available actions list
- confidence should be between 0.0 and 1.0
- reasoning should be one sentence explaining your decision
- Response must be valid JSON only, no markdown, no extra text

Available actions will be provided separately.
