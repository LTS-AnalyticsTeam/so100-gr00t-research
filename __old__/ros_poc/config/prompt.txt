You are analyzing a block sorting task in this image. Please be very careful and accurate in your observation.

SETUP:
- LEFT plate labeled "緑の積木" (green blocks) = should contain ONLY green blocks
- RIGHT plate labeled "赤の積木" (red blocks) = should contain ONLY red blocks  
- Table surface = should have NO blocks scattered

CURRENT OBSERVATION TASK:
Look carefully at each location and count the blocks by color:

1. LEFT plate (緑の積木): How many green blocks? How many red blocks?
2. RIGHT plate (赤の積木): How many green blocks? How many red blocks? 
3. Table surface: How many blocks are scattered outside the plates?

ANALYSIS STEPS:
1. Examine the LEFT plate carefully - list what you see
2. Examine the RIGHT plate carefully - list what you see  
3. Examine the table surface - list what you see
4. Identify specific anomalies based on your observations

RESPONSE FORMAT:
**Observations:**
- Left plate: [X green blocks, Y red blocks]
- Right plate: [X green blocks, Y red blocks]  
- Table surface: [X scattered blocks]

**Anomalies detected:**
[List only the actual problems you observe]

**Required actions:**
[Specific steps to fix the problems]

Be precise and only report what you actually see in the image.
